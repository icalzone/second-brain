Yellowstone National Park is a pinnacle destination, home to vast wilderness areas, geothermal features, and abundant wildlife.

The most RV-friendly campgrounds within the park include Bridge Bay, Canyon, Fishing Bridge, Grant Village, and Madison, all reservable through the park's [lodges website](https://www.yellowstonenationalparklodges.com/) or [recreation.gov​](https://www.recreation.gov/camping/gateways/2988).

All sites typically require advance reservations, with the notable exception of Mammoth Campground, which offers first-come, first-served spots from [October 15 to April 1](https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/campgrounds.htm).

Ideally, set aside at least a week for an in-depth exploration, but if you're short on time, we recommend staying at least three days to cover the main attractions.

Your journey should include the renowned Old Faithful geyser, which erupts like clockwork [every 90 minutes](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23377-secret-chamber-under-old-faithful-drives-eruptions/) — watch it from a safe distance or join a guided tour to learn about the park's geothermal features.

Don't miss other highlights like the Grand Prismatic Spring and Yellowstone Lake, and for [stunning sunrise or sunset views](https://tripmemos.com/sunrise-and-sunset-spots-in-yellowstone/), head to the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone.

## Grand Teton National Park

## Glacier National Park

![Majestic view over the Glacier National Park](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/1200x675,sO8LMvNEXVBnAh1RHKnDRqHQm0VLs9TvCJP-SralGvZo/https://tripmemos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Majestic-view-over-the-Glacier-National-Park.jpg)

The park boasts [13 front-country campgrounds](https://www.nps.gov/glac/planyourvisit/camping.htm), providing various options for tent camping or RV camping, which also varies in use and setting, offering a unique experience amidst Glacier's natural beauty.​

When planning your RV camping trip to Glacier National Park, it's important to note that most campgrounds are reservation-only and can be booked on [Recreation.gov](https://www.recreation.gov/).

Given the park's popularity, booking your site before arriving is recommended, as cell service is spotty and unreliable throughout the park. 

Campgrounds such as Apgar, Fish Creek, Sprague Creek, Avalanche, St. Mary, Many Glacier, and Two Medicine can be reserved in advance, while a few smaller ones operate on a first-come, first-served basis.

If you're seeking a memorable RV journey, this [3-day Glacier National Park itinerary](https://tripmemos.com/glacier-national-park-itinerary/) is a must-read!

## Yosemite National Park

Reservations, highly sought after, can be made up to five months in advance, with the best chances of securing a spot by booking right when reservations open.

Engage in Jeep tours, winery tours, or biking tours around the area. The wine trails are particularly popular for adult-only trips​.

You can also embark on hiking trails that wind past Yosemite Falls and the Merced River or explore the majestic Sequoia & Kings Canyon and Mariposa Grove.
