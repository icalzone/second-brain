My family and I visited Great Smoky Mountains National Park in September and absolutely loved it. Even with the crowds typical of the fall season, there was still so much beauty and adventure across the park's vast wilderness. 

With over half a million acres to explore, planning ahead is a must to make the most of your visit. I'm sharing our list of favorite sights, landmarks, and activities in the hopes it will help fellow travelers plan their own unforgettable Smoky Mountain adventure. 

I also put these spots on a map (at the end of the list) so you can see where everything is and how to plan your itinerary. 

As always, leave a comment to let us know your thoughts. What are your park favorites? What would you add to this list? Let us know, and we may add them so we can check them out during our next visit!

Clingmans Dome, mentioned above, is one such spot where the trail is actually part of the Appalachian Trail. We just thought the AT was worth an additional mention on this list, in its own right. And now, let's talk about a few other trails that are worth your attention.

## More Ways to Enjoy the Park

In addition to its most popular landmarks and sights, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park offers abundant opportunities for outdoor recreation and adventure. 

Go [horseback riding](https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/horseriding.htm) with a guided tour along scenic trails, take a ranger-led tour for fascinating historical and ecological insights, or challenge yourself camping in remote backcountry sites.

The park also caters to cycling enthusiasts, with the popular 11-mile Cades Cove Loop offering stunning valley vistas. 

![Bike Riding in Cades Cove, Great Smoky Mountain National Park](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/1200x900,siaGtSpMbW5dpBztHplcdx3rdZ2kMhLqcXhbPhUW_EWQ/https://tripmemos.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Bike-Riding-in-Cades-Cove-Great-Smoky-Mountain-National-Park1.jpg)

Wildlife lovers (that's everyone, right?) may spot black bears, white-tailed deer, and over 200 species of birds. In fact, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park was where our family had the most bear sightings in a single park, except for Denali and Glacier National Park.

Anglers will enjoy [fishing](https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/fishing.htm) for native brook, brown, and rainbow trout in the park's crystal-clear streams. Or join in the fun during a [seasonal festival](https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/special-events.htm) or cultural event ranging from music concerts to artisan demonstrations.
