The ultimate trifecta of mountain parks, **Grand Teton**, **Yellowstone** and **Glacier National Park** make for one of the greatest road trips on the planet. It’s easily one of the best national park road trips in America. Driving from Wyoming to and across Montana, you’ll discover historic sites, encounter iconic wildlife and see unforgettable landscapes.

These three [parks in the northern Rocky Mountains](https://www.travel-experience-live.com/ultimate-northern-rockies-national-parks-road-trip/) are among the most popular in the United States, attracting over eleven million visitors between them each year. That popularity is justified, though.

From the [towering Teton Range](https://www.travel-experience-live.com/best-grand-teton-national-park-sunrise-locations/) to Yellowstone’s geysers and [megafauna](https://www.travel-experience-live.com/yellowstone-national-park-wildlife-watching-guide/), and the breathtaking [valleys of Glacier](https://www.travel-experience-live.com/glacier-national-park-photography-locations-ideas/), this road trip allows you to immerse yourself in some of the world’s grandest natural scenery.

In fact, both the Grand Teton-Yellowstone area and Glacier National Park are UNESCO Biosphere Reserves _and_ World Heritage Sites, attesting to the region’s immense natural beauty and resources of global importance.

Spend a couple of weeks exploring northern Wyoming and Montana, the very minimum amount of time you’ll need to see these three spectacular parks. [See grizzly bears](https://www.travel-experience-live.com/best-national-parks-to-see-brown-grizzly-bears-usa/), [wolves](https://www.travel-experience-live.com/best-national-parks-to-see-wolves-in-america/), bighorn sheep, [moose](https://www.travel-experience-live.com/best-national-parks-to-see-moose-wild/) and [American bison](https://www.travel-experience-live.com/best-national-parks-to-see-bison-in-usa/) in the wild, among lots of other animals.

Drive world-class roads, such as the Yellowstone Grand Loop Road and [Going-to-the-Sun Road](https://www.travel-experience-live.com/ultimate-guide-going-to-the-sun-road-highlights-glacier/), kayak on alpine lakes, sample local huckleberry products, camp under the stars or stay at amazing historic lodges, visit Native American and pioneer sites,… The list of activities goes on and on.

### 9\. Dakota Black Hills & Badlands

While the Dakotas are known best for their vast prairie landscapes and cowboy culture, both states also boast some spectacular natural scenery.

All of the greatest [national parks in South Dakota](https://www.travel-experience-live.com/must-visit-national-parks-in-south-dakota/) and [North Dakota](https://www.travel-experience-live.com/5-national-parks-in-north-dakota/) are concentrated in the states’ western part.

In southwestern North Dakota, **Theodore Roosevelt National Park**—the only national park named after a [U.S. President](https://www.travel-experience-live.com/presidential-national-parks-birthplaces-homes-memorials/)—encompasses lush badlands, sprawling grasslands and a number of historic sites.

A scenic road loops through the heart of [its South Unit](https://www.travel-experience-live.com/south-unit-theodore-roosevelt-national-park-attractions/), passing by amazing viewpoints, beautiful scenery along the Little Missouri River and offering excellent wildlife viewing opportunities.

After exploring this underrated national park for a day or two, head south to the legendary South Dakota Black Hills.

This relatively small area, an island of hills and forests amid endless prairie, is home to several [National Park Service units](https://www.travel-experience-live.com/complete-list-of-all-national-park-service-units-sites/), a gorgeous state park and a large national forest.

In the Black Hills, a sacred area in Lakota culture, you can visit **Wind Cave National Park**, encompassing one of the world’s largest known caves, as well as grasslands, forests and slopes. [Watch for wildlife](https://www.travel-experience-live.com/best-places-to-see-wildlife-in-wind-cave-national-park/) like American bison, pronghorn, prairie dogs, coyotes, [rattlesnakes](https://www.travel-experience-live.com/what-to-do-rattlesnake-encounter-while-hiking/) and elk.

Also in the Black Hills, you’ll find **Mount Rushmore National Memorial**, one of the most famous landmarks in the entire United States. A number of scenic drives link all these parks together, also taking in **Jewel Cave National Monument** and [Custer State Park](https://www.blackhillsbadlands.com/parks-monuments/custer-state-park), which is renowned for its wildlife.

A short drive to the east from the Black Hills lie the jaw-dropping South Dakota Badlands, protected as **Badlands National Park**.

This is a truly sensational place to drive through, the Badlands Loop Road lined with numerous overlooks, [wonderful Badlands hiking trails](https://www.travel-experience-live.com/best-day-hikes-in-badlands-national-park/), boardwalks and a few historic sites.

Although you can get a sense of Badlands National Park in just one day, I strongly recommend spending at least one night and one more day there. Both the [sunrises](https://www.travel-experience-live.com/best-places-to-see-sunrise-in-badlands-national-park/) and [sunsets in the Badlands](https://www.travel-experience-live.com/best-places-to-see-sunset-in-badlands-national-park/) are unforgettable, while the star-studded night sky is among the grandest in the nation.

A nice side trip when driving the Badlands Loop Road is the **Minuteman Missile National Historic Site**, which preserves an arsenal of nuclear missiles dating from the Cold War.

#### Alternative Itineraries

_If you have more time at your disposal, you can also add iconic Devils Tower National Monument to your itinerary. The first-ever designated national monument, Devils Tower is just northwest of the Black Hills in Wyoming._

_Alternatively, you can leave out Theodore Roosevelt National Park and just focus on the South Dakota Black Hills and Badlands region. There’s plenty to see and do there to keep you busy for at least a whole week or more._

### 10\. Florida Keys, Everglades & Coral Reefs

Clustered in and around the southern tip of Florida are three amazing national parks and one national preserve. Together, these four National Park Service units preserve various vulnerable ecosystems, protecting them against the raging urban development of greater Miami.

Miami, or nearby Fort Lauderdale, both of which are home to an international airport, are the typical starting point for a road trip to the national parks of Florida.

The first park many people visit is **Everglades National Park**, situated [just west of Miami](https://www.travel-experience-live.com/national-parks-near-miami-florida/).

The [third-largest national park](https://www.travel-experience-live.com/all-us-national-parks-ranked-by-size/) in the contiguous United States after Death Valley and Yellowstone, Everglades encompasses sprawling sawgrass marshes, hardwood hammocks, mangrove-lined coastline, and the shallow waters of Florida Bay.

This is one of the best places in America for wildlife watching. In fact, the Everglades are _the only place in the world_ where [alligators and crocodiles live side by side](https://www.travel-experience-live.com/where-to-see-alligators-and-crocodiles-in-the-everglades/).

Additionally, you can also see a positively mindboggling number of [bird species in the Everglades](https://www.travel-experience-live.com/birds-of-everglades-national-park-big-cypress/). From roseate spoonbills, great egrets, green herons, and wood storks to owls, red-shouldered hawks, osprey, pelicans, and vultures, Everglades National Park is one of the world’s premier birding destinations.

Just north of Everglades National Park lies **Big Cypress National Preserve**. This park protects a large area of mainly cypress swamps. Here, too, you can see alligators and an incredible variety of birds.

I recommend dedicating at least three days to Everglades National Park, which allows you to explore all main areas in the park, including Royal Palm, Flamingo, and Shark Valley.

Spend one day in Big Cypress National Preserve, situated just west of Shark Valley, before moving on to the next South Florida park—**Biscayne National Park**.

Biscayne is just east of the Everglades and south of Miami. One of the largest marine parks in the United States, Biscayne National Park is 95% water. It protects most of shallow Biscayne Bay, as well as a stretch of mangrove-fringed shoreline and a number of Florida Keys.

In just one day, you can see most of [Biscayne’s top attractions](https://www.travel-experience-live.com/top-things-to-do-in-biscayne-national-park/). Explore the visitor center and art gallery at Convoy Point before going for a boat tour in Biscayne Bay.

On guided boat tours, you get to visit Boca Chita Key and its iconic lighthouse, cruise through Stiltsville, and spend some time snorkeling or scuba diving in the Florida Reef, one of the largest coral reefs on the planet.

After Biscayne National Park, it’s time for a scenic drive through the famed Florida Keys, from Key Largo all the way to Key West. Although there are no National Park Service sites here, you need to get to [Key West](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100449465-11552045?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expedia.com%2FKey-West-Hotels.d1187.Travel-Guide-Hotels) to visit **Dry Tortugas National Park**.

The Dry Tortugas are a small and remote group of islands almost 70 miles west of Key West. They’re the actual end of the Florida Keys island chain.

Dry Tortugas National Park can be visited on day trips with a high-speed catamaran from Key West (or by seaplane).

On a day trip, you can [explore massive Fort Jefferson](https://www.travel-experience-live.com/best-things-to-do-in-dry-tortugas-national-park/), see rare sea birds, sunbathe on one of the best beaches in the Florida Keys, and explore the park’s spectacular underwater world.
